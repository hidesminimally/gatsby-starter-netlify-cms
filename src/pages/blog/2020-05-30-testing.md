In the opening chapter of *Moby Dick*, Ishmael laments that the “Fates” have sent him on a “shabby” whaling voyage, while other men of his epoch are sent on “magnificent” ventures instead. One such “high tragedy” was the “Bloody Battle in Afghanistan,” which Ishmael describes as among the “more extensive performances” in “the grand programme of Providence.” In the hundred and seventy years since the publication of *Moby Dick*, imperial providence has programmed a chain of bloody battles that have only become lengthier and bloodier: since 1978, Afghanistan has been in the grips of near continuous war, with two separate invasions by two different superpowers, a brutal civil war, and unremitting slaughter and destruction.

Despite being entangled in Afghanistan for many years, outsiders retain a deeply simplistic conception of the country: in the media and in Washington, it is primarily viewed through a pernicious Orientalist lens, as a place of backwards customs and intractable intertribal warfare. This rigid and impoverished perception clashes with the lived experiences of Afghans, and the resulting schism is part of the reason why the United States has repeatedly failed to pacify the insurgency.

The ongoing occupation of Afghanistan is the longest foreign military operation in US history. The direct economic cost has reached over $975 billion. Upwards of 2,400 US soldiers have died in the war. But the Americans have very little to show after nearly eighteen years in the country. The Taliban continues to hold sway over large swathes of the countryside, while the US-backed government — in which abominable warlords occupy powerful positions — is embroiled in corruption, torture, and human rights abuses. The much-vaunted emancipation of Afghan women has never materialized; on the contrary, violence against women continues to be endemic throughout the country. Trapped in a perpetual nightmare, Afghan women continue to suffer the same hardships of war that began decades ago with the Soviet occupation, while all along being subjected to the penalties imposed by a conservative patriarchal society.

Neta C. Crawford, a professor of political science at Boston University, published a report in November 2018 for the Costs of War Project that calculated the human casualties of the war: since 2001, over 38,480 Afghan civilians have died, and 41, 000have been gravely injured. Almost two million Afghans are internally displaced — refugees in their own country. The war has also spilled into neighboring Pakistan, with over sixty-four thousand Pakistanis killed. US drone strikes account for an estimated 3,800 of those deaths — mostly civilians. Pakistan is also host to the largest number of Afghan refugees — 1.3 million (the number has declined from a reported 4 million at the end of 2001) out of a total of 2.6 million worldwide in 2017. Additionally, there are a hundred and seventy thousand internally displaced people in Pakistan (the vast majority of them from the tribal belt along the Afghan border).

The tragedy of the “War in Afghanistan and Pakistan” goes far beyond the number of casualties and displaced people. Alex Edney-Browne, a researcher on drone warfare, has documented some of the psychological trauma that Afghans have suffered as a result of American drone strikes. She interviewed a man named Abdul Qodus from Wardak province who saw “pieces” of his “brother’s body” scattered about after a drone strike. Qodus is perpetually forced to relive this terrifying event as drones regularly fly over his village, making a characteristic buzzing sound as they hover above. “All day and all night it is there,” he said, later adding that going outside means “we go with fear, we go quickly.” In interviews conducted by The Intercept in 2017, Afghans lamented that the US was treating their villages “as a playground for their weapons.”

## Where Britain Was, the US Follows

This is far from the first time a foreign power has made Afghanistan its playing field. In an article for the Pakistan-based magazine *Tanqeed*, James Caron, researcher at SOAS University of London, notes that from a “metropolitan” perspective, “the Pashtun heartland, forever garrisoned on the borders of empires, has always been more interesting to power as a problem rather than as an asset.” This was the viewpoint of imperial Britain (adopted later by the Soviet Union and the US) at the height of the so-called Great Game.

The Great Game was a powerful rivalry between the British and Russian empires over the dominion of Afghanistan and adjacent territories in Central and South Asia from 1837 to 1907, fought primarily on the mountain ranges of the northwest frontier of British India, beyond which lay Afghanistan. The region now constitutes the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of northwestern Pakistan.

To combat Russian intrusions in Central Asia and eliminate the almost entirely fictitious threat to India (the “jewel in the crown” of the empire), the British East India Company initiated the first Anglo-Afghan War in 1839 — the catastrophic colonial campaign that Melville alludes to in *Moby Dick*. The British formed “The Army of the Indus” (a reference to the ancient Indus River) to oust the Afghan ruler Dost Mohammad Khan and replace him with the subservient Shah Shuja, who had been living in exile. The invading force consisted of more than twenty thousand soldiers and a stupendous thirty-eight thousand camp followers. It entered the country with relative ease, capturing Kabul within seven months. Dost Mohammad Khan was exiled, and Shah Shuja acceded to the throne of Kabul. As part of the incursion, the British also subdued the Khanate of Kalat (now a district in the Balochistan province of Pakistan). Hearing the news of Kabul’s capitulation, a British official boasted to the Khan of Kalat: “The British army has entered Kabul without firing a bullet.” Upon reflection, the Khan of Kalat is said to have replied, “You people have entered the country, but how will you get out?”

The words proved to be prescient. In the winter of 1841, the British garrison in Kabul was attacked during an uprising and incurred significant losses. The garrison was besieged, and the city descended into anarchy. A month later, in January 1842, the British officers in Kabul managed to negotiate a withdrawal to Jalalabad. The winter march towards Jalalabad proved to be a disaster as the great army perished under incessant Afghan fire from the mountaintops (tribesmen largely ignored the negotiated agreement), disease, starvation, and the bitter cold. The demise of the British force entered legend, particularly the image of the solitary Dr. Brydon on horseback, vividly described by Karl Marx in *Notes on Indian History*: “On the walls of Jalalabad . . . the sentries espied a man in a tattered English uniform on a miserable pony horse, and the man was desperately wounded; it was Dr. Brydon, the sole survivor of the 15,000 who had left Kabul three weeks before. He was dying of starvation.”

After the devastating defeat, the British sent additional forces to secure the release of prisoners and to carry out retributions against the Afghan populace. But the political situation in the country was essentially unchanged by the war: Dost Mohammad Khan was back as the ruler of the country and Shah Shuja was dead. The British had fought a costly war for naught. This was not, however, the end of British attempts to exert control over Afghanistan. There were two further Anglo-Afghan Wars and recurrent military operations against tribal Pashtuns along the Durand Line. Imposed in 1893, the line forms the modern border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Indeed, it was the British that first carried out indiscriminate aerial bombardments in the region, a policy they described as “air policing.” As Madiha Tahir has pointed out in her essay “Bombing Pakistan: How Colonial Legacy Sustains American Drones,” these colonial bombing campaigns, beginning with Winston Churchhill’s bombing of Jalalabad in 1919, were the logical predecessor of the drone warfare that currently dominates life in Afghanistan and the northwestern borderlands of Pakistan.

But Afghanistan is more than just a theatre of war. It is a geographically and culturally diverse country, with expansive deserts, soaring mountains, and ceaseless ranges, including the Hindu Kush and Pamir Mountains, the latter known as the “Roof of the World.” Water is scarce, and a meagre 12 percent of the soil is arable. This harsh terrain is home to several different ethnic groups. The south and east are populated by Pashtuns, the largest ethnic group in Afghanistan (they are also indigenous to Pakistan’s northwestern regions). In the north and west are Tajiks and Uzbeks. The Hazaras are mostly situated in the central part of the country. Pashto and Dari (a dialect of Persian) are the two most widely spoken languages. Most of the population is rural.

The mountainous geography of the region has forged a society that has historically been both fractured and isolated. More significantly, the Afghan tribes have typically not responded positively to reform or an assertive centralized authority. As scholars Eqbal Ahmad and Richard J. Barnet noted\
in an extensive 1988 essay in The New Yorker, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 brought all these factors into play. The war was an important precursor to the current conflict. In fact, the invasion really cemented the beginning of a broader conflict in Afghanistan that rages on into the present.

## The Soviets

The Soviet–Afghan War, lasting from 1979 to 1989, was one of the longest and costliest foreign military operations undertaken by the USSR. The war also marked the beginning of substantial American involvement in the region. Prior to the Soviet invasion, the US had showed limited interest in Afghanistan. However, in response to the Soviet intervention the CIA carried out an expansive covert operation in the country — arming, training, and funding the resistance. The mujahideen received an estimated $10 billion in weapons and aid from the US, Saudi Arabia, and their allies. Representative Charlie Wilson, from Texas, one of the strongest supporters of the Afghan resistance, echoed the prevailing sentiment in Washington at the time: “There were fifty-eight thousand dead in Vietnam and we owe the Russians one.”

The Soviet invasion started off as a limited operation to bolster the increasingly beleaguered Afghan government and swiftly suppress the spreading insurgency. At the time of the invasion in 1979, Afghanistan was governed by the People’s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA), formed in 1965 by a small group of men belonging to Kabul’s leftist intelligentsia (predominantly Marxist-Leninist) during the presidency of Muhammad Daud Khan. The relationship between the domestic left and Daud Khan had deteriorated despite the fact that several members of the PDPA had helped Daud oust his brother in law, the king of Afghanistan, Muhammad Zahir Shah, in a bloodless coup that transformed Afghanistan from monarchy to republic.

The rift stemmed from Daud Khan’s ambitions to broaden Afghanistan’s diplomatic profile by joining “a Western-tilted, Tehran-centered regional economic and security sphere.” As part of the deal, the Shah of Iran promised $2 billion in aid to Afghanistan. In exchange, Tehran pressured Daud to curb the government’s dependence on the Soviet Union and suppress internal leftist influence. This eventually culminated in a new constitution that banned all political parties except for Daud’s own. The government also began purging PDPA members from the military and civil institutions. In 1978, after a large funeral demonstration took place in Kabul over the killing of a leading PDPA membe
